## Introduction

This analysis explores the famous Titanic dataset, examining passenger information and survival rates from the tragic voyage. Using Python, we'll investigate various factors that influenced survival probability, including passenger class, gender, age, and other variables. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we'll uncover patterns from this historical dataset.
